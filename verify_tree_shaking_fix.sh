echo "Summary of Changes:"
echo "- Replaced non-constant IconData() constructors with constant icon mappings"
echo "- Added static _iconCodePointMap with commonly used Material Design icons"
echo "- Updated getIconFromCodePoint methods to use constant lookups"
echo "- Maintained backward compatibility for all existing usages"
echo "- Added comprehensive test coverage for the fix"

echo "The tree shaking issue should now be resolved. You can build with:"
echo "  flutter build apk --tree-shake-icons"
echo "  flutter build appbundle --tree-shake-icons"
