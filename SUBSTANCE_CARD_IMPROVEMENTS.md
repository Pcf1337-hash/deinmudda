# Substance Card Overflow Fix & Glassmorphism Enhancement

## Overview
Fixed the "BOTTOM OVERFLOWED BY 34 PIXELS" issue in the dosage calculator screen and implemented a modern glassmorphism design with enhanced substance cards.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Overflow Issues
- **Problem**: Substance cards with recommended dose values and "Berechnen" button caused overflow on smaller screens
- **Solution**: Implemented responsive layout using `LayoutBuilder`, `IntrinsicHeight`, and `Flexible` widgets
- **Benefits**: Cards now adapt to available space without hard-coded heights

### 2. New Widget Components

#### DangerBadge (`lib/widgets/dosage_calculator/danger_badge.dart`)
- Displays substance danger level (Niedrig, Mittel, Hoch, Kritisch)
- Color-coded badges with icons
- Automatic detection based on substance name
- Compact and full display modes

#### DosageLevelIndicator (`lib/widgets/dosage_calculator/dosage_level_indicator.dart`)
- Shows dosage levels with green-yellow-red color coding
- Displays recommended dose when user weight is available
- Responsive layout with proper text scaling
- Supports both per-kg and total dosage display

#### SubstanceGlassCard (`lib/widgets/dosage_calculator/substance_glass_card.dart`)
- Glassmorphism effect with backdrop blur
- Animated interactions with glow effects
- Substance-specific color themes
- Responsive design with proper shadows

#### SubstanceQuickCard (`lib/widgets/dosage_calculator/substance_quick_card.dart`)
- Main substance card component
- Fixes overflow issues with flexible layouts
- Supports both compact and full display modes
- Integrates all sub-components seamlessly

### 3. Enhanced Design Features

#### Glassmorphism Effects
- Translucent cards with backdrop blur
- Substance-specific color schemes
- Smooth glow animations on interaction
- Rounded corners and subtle borders

#### Improved Icons
- Substance-specific icons (heart for MDMA, brain for LSD, etc.)
- Consistent icon sizing and positioning
- Color-matched with substance themes

#### Responsive Layout
- Cards adapt to screen size automatically
- No fixed heights causing overflow
- Proper text scaling and truncation
- Flexible content arrangement

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```dart
SubstanceQuickCard(
  substance: substance,
  userWeight: 70.0,
  onTap: () => _calculateDosage(substance),
)
```

### Compact Mode
```dart
SubstanceQuickCard(
  substance: substance,
  isCompact: true,
  onTap: () => _calculateDosage(substance),
)
```

### Grid Layout
```dart
SubstanceGridCard(
  substance: substance,
  userWeight: userWeight,
  onTap: () => _calculateDosage(substance),
)
```

## Demo
Run the demo to see the improvements:
```bash
flutter run lib/demo/substance_card_demo.dart
```

## Key Improvements

1. **No More Overflow**: Cards now adapt to content without fixed heights
2. **Glassmorphism Design**: Modern translucent glass effect with blur
3. **Substance-Specific Colors**: Each substance has its own color theme
4. **Danger Level Indicators**: Visual safety indicators for each substance
5. **Responsive Dosage Display**: Shows recommended doses based on user weight
6. **Smooth Animations**: Interactive feedback with glow effects
7. **Improved Typography**: Better font weights and sizing
8. **Flexible Layout**: Cards work on all screen sizes

## Technical Details

- Used `LayoutBuilder` for responsive design
- Implemented `IntrinsicHeight` for flexible card heights
- Added `Flexible` and `Expanded` widgets to prevent overflow
- Used `FittedBox` for text scaling
- Implemented `BackdropFilter` for glassmorphism effects
- Added substance-specific color mapping in `DesignTokens`

## Testing

Run the widget tests to verify the fixes:
```bash
flutter test test/widgets/substance_quick_card_test.dart
```

The tests verify:
- No overflow errors occur
- Cards render properly in different sizes
- Dosage information displays correctly
- Compact mode works as expected
