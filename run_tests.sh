# Comprehensive Test Execution Script
# Phase 7: Advanced Testing & CI/CD Implementation
# 
# This script runs all test suites with proper reporting
# Usage: ./run_tests.sh [test_type]
# 
# Test types:
#   all        - Run all tests (default)
#   unit       - Unit tests only
#   integration - Integration tests only
#   performance - Performance tests only
#   load       - Load tests only
#   coverage   - Tests with coverage report
