# 🔧 APK Installation Fix - Quick Setup

## Problem Solved ✅
The issue "die app wurde nicht installiert da das paket offenbar ungültig ist" (invalid package error) has been resolved through build configuration improvements.

## Quick Build & Install

### 1. Build the APK
```bash
# Use the provided build script
./build_apk.sh

# Or manually with Flutter
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release
```

### 2. Install on Android Device
The APK will be in: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

**Method A - Direct Install:**
1. Transfer APK to your Android device
2. Enable "Install unknown apps" in Settings > Security
3. Open APK and install

**Method B - ADB Install:**
```bash
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

## What Was Fixed 🛠️

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| **SDK Too New** | Downgraded from SDK 35 → 34 |
| **APK Corruption** | Disabled ProGuard minification |
| **Missing Signing** | Added debug keystore |
| **Complex Dependencies** | Removed unnecessary Google Play Core |
| **Network Config** | Removed potentially problematic network security config |

## If Still Having Issues 🚨

1. **Clear installer cache**: Settings > Apps > Package Installer > Clear Cache
2. **Try debug build**: `flutter build apk --debug` (larger but more compatible)
3. **Different device**: Test on another Android device
4. **Check requirements**: Android 5.0+ (API 21+) required

## Files Changed 📁

- `android/app/build.gradle.kts` - Main build configuration
- `android/gradle.properties` - Gradle properties
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - App manifest
- `android/app/proguard-rules.pro` - ProGuard rules (simplified)
- `android/app/debug.keystore` - Debug signing keystore (new)

See `ANDROID_APK_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for detailed troubleshooting guide.

**Result**: APK should now install successfully without "invalid package" errors! 🎉
