# HomeScreen Cleanup & Substanz-Timer Implementation

## Summary
This implementation fulfills all the requirements from the problem statement for HomeScreen cleanup and Substanz-Timer integration.

## Changes Made

### 1. HomeScreen Cleanup
- **Removed** `_buildQuickActionsSection()` method and its usage
- **Removed** `_buildAdvancedFeaturesSection()` method and its usage
- **Removed** `_buildQuickActionCard()` method (no longer needed)
- **Removed** the following buttons from home screen:
  - Neuer Eintrag (now in SpeedDial)
  - Quick Buttons verwalten (removed)
  - Erweiterte Suche (removed)
  - Musteranalyse (removed)
  - Daten Export/Import (removed)

### 2. Active Timer Display
- **Created** `ActiveTimerBar` widget in `lib/widgets/active_timer_bar.dart`
- **Added** conditional display: `if (_activeTimer != null) ActiveTimerBar(timer: _activeTimer)`
- **Features**:
  - Shows substance name and remaining time
  - Animated progress bar
  - Pulsing animation for visual feedback
  - Tap to navigate to timer dashboard

### 3. SpeedDial Implementation
- **Created** `SpeedDial` widget in `lib/widgets/speed_dial.dart`
- **Replaced** `FloatingActionButton` with `SpeedDial`
- **Actions**:
  - "Neuer Eintrag" (always available)
  - "Timer stoppen" (only when timer is active)
- **Features**:
  - Smooth expand/collapse animation
  - Background overlay when expanded
  - Customizable actions and colors

### 4. QuickEntry Timer Integration
- **Modified** `_handleQuickEntry()` method to automatically start timers
- **Added** substance duration retrieval with fallback
- **Timer Logic**:
  - Gets duration from `substance.duration` property
  - Falls back to 4 hours if no duration specified
  - Creates entry and starts timer in one operation
  - Shows timer confirmation in SnackBar

### 5. Single Timer Constraint
- **Enhanced** `TimerService` to enforce only one active timer
- **Added** `currentActiveTimer` getter
- **Added** `hasAnyActiveTimer` getter
- **Logic**: Before starting new timer, stops any existing active timer

### 6. Error Handling
- **Used** `addPostFrameCallback` for all setState calls to avoid setState during build
- **Added** proper error handling in timer operations
- **Added** try-catch blocks for all async operations

## New Files Created

### `lib/widgets/active_timer_bar.dart`
- Displays active timer information
- Animated progress bar and pulsing effect
- Responsive design for light/dark themes

### `lib/widgets/speed_dial.dart`
- Reusable SpeedDial component
- Customizable actions and appearance
- Smooth animations and user feedback

## Modified Files

### `lib/screens/home_screen.dart`
- Removed unwanted sections
- Added timer state management
- Integrated ActiveTimerBar and SpeedDial
- Enhanced QuickEntry with automatic timer start

### `lib/services/timer_service.dart`
- Added single-timer constraint
- Enhanced with new getter methods
- Improved timer management logic

## Key Features

1. **Clean Interface**: Removed cluttered quick actions and advanced features
2. **Visual Timer Feedback**: ActiveTimerBar shows timer status prominently
3. **Intuitive Actions**: SpeedDial provides essential actions in a clean UI
4. **Automatic Timer Start**: QuickEntry buttons automatically start timers
5. **Single Timer Logic**: Only one timer can be active at a time
6. **Robust Error Handling**: Proper setState management and error handling
7. **Fallback Duration**: 4-hour fallback when substance has no duration

## Usage

1. **Creating Entry with Timer**: Use QuickEntry buttons to automatically create entry and start timer
2. **Viewing Active Timer**: ActiveTimerBar appears at top when timer is running
3. **Stopping Timer**: Use SpeedDial "Timer stoppen" action or navigate to timer dashboard
4. **Adding Entry**: Use SpeedDial "Neuer Eintrag" action for manual entry creation

## Technical Implementation

- **State Management**: Local state for active timer
- **Service Integration**: TimerService, SubstanceService, EntryService
- **Widget Architecture**: Modular, reusable components
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions and visual feedback
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

All requirements from the problem statement have been implemented successfully.
