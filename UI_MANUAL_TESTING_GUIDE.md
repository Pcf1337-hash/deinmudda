## üîç Testing Procedures

### Screen Size Testing
1. Use browser dev tools or device emulators
2. Test at these widths: 320px, 375px, 414px, 600px, 800px+
3. Check both portrait and landscape orientations
4. Verify all content is accessible without horizontal scrolling

### Text Scaling Testing
1. Go to device accessibility settings
2. Set text size to largest available
3. Check all text remains readable
4. Verify no text gets cut off
5. Test with extreme scaling (3x if possible)

### Animation Testing
1. Enable "Slow animations" in developer options
2. Test all animations at reduced speed
3. Check for stuttering or frame drops
4. Verify animations complete properly
5. Test animation interruption/cancellation

### Performance Testing
1. Use Flutter Inspector to check widget rebuilds
2. Monitor memory usage during animations
3. Test with slow/older devices
4. Check for memory leaks in long-running animations
5. Test with many widgets on screen

## üêõ Common Issues to Look For

### Overflow Issues
- Text cutting off at edges
- Widgets extending beyond screen boundaries
- Horizontal scrolling when it shouldn't exist
- Content hidden behind other widgets

### Theme Issues
- Poor contrast ratios
- Inconsistent colors across screens
- Missing theme adaptations
- Incorrect text colors on backgrounds

### Animation Issues
- Stuttering or dropped frames
- Animations not completing
- Overlapping animations
- Performance degradation

### Consistency Issues
- Different styling for same elements
- Inconsistent spacing/padding
- Different font sizes for same text types
- Inconsistent icon usage

## üõ†Ô∏è Fix Validation

After implementing any fixes:

1. **Re-run all failed tests**
2. **Test on multiple devices**
3. **Verify no new issues introduced**
4. **Check performance impact**
5. **Update test documentation**
