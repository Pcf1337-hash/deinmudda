# Multi-Timer Display Feature

## Overview

The Multi-Timer Display is a new innovative widget that replaces the old single-timer bar with a modern, tile-based design that can display multiple active timers simultaneously.

## Features

### Visual Design
- **Glassmorphism Theme**: Consistent with the app's design language
- **Dynamic Color Coding**: Progress-based color transitions (green → cyan → yellow → orange → red)
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to single or multiple timers automatically
- **Smooth Animations**: Slide-in effects and staggered animations for multiple tiles

### Layout Modes

#### Single Timer Mode
When only one timer is active:
- Displays a full-width card with detailed information
- Shows circular progress indicator with percentage
- Includes substance name and remaining time
- Height: 80px with full visual details

#### Multiple Timer Mode
When multiple timers are active:
- Shows a header with timer count and "View All" button
- Horizontal scrollable tile layout
- Each tile is 160px wide with compact information
- Staggered entrance animations for visual appeal

### User Interactions
- **Tap to Navigate**: All timer displays navigate to the Timer Dashboard
- **Timer Management**: FAB now shows "Timer verwalten" instead of stopping single timer
- **Accessibility**: Proper tooltips and semantic labels

## Technical Implementation

### Widget Structure
```
MultiTimerDisplay
├── CrashProtectionWrapper (Error Handling)
├── Consumer2<TimerService, PsychedelicThemeService> (State Management)
└── AnimatedBuilder (Slide Animations)
    ├── Single Timer Card (1 timer)
    └── Multiple Timer Layout (2+ timers)
        ├── Header Row (count + view all)
        └── Horizontal ListView (scrollable tiles)
```

### Key Components

#### Color System
- Progress-based color transitions with 5 stages
- Psychedelic mode support with enhanced effects
- Automatic text contrast calculation

#### Animation System
- Respects Impeller renderer capabilities
- Graceful fallbacks for performance-constrained devices
- Staggered animations for multiple tiles

#### Error Handling
- Comprehensive crash protection
- Fallback UI for error states
- Detailed logging for debugging

## Breaking Changes

### Removed Functionality
- `_stopActiveTimer()` function removed from HomeScreen
- Single timer focus in FAB actions replaced with timer management

### Updated Behavior
- Home screen now shows ALL active timers instead of just one
- FAB "Timer stoppen" button replaced with "Timer verwalten"
- Navigation leads to Timer Dashboard for all timer interactions

## Usage Examples

### Basic Implementation
```dart
MultiTimerDisplay(
  onTimerTap: () => Navigator.push(context, TimerDashboardScreen.route()),
  onEmptyStateTap: () => Navigator.push(context, TimerDashboardScreen.route()),
)
```

### In Home Screen
```dart
// Replace old ActiveTimerBar
LayoutErrorBoundary(
  debugLabel: 'Multi Timer Display',
  child: RepaintBoundary(
    child: MultiTimerDisplay(
      onTimerTap: () => _navigateToTimerDashboard(),
    ).animate().fadeIn(
      duration: DesignTokens.animationMedium,
      delay: const Duration(milliseconds: 200),
    ),
  ),
),
```

## Benefits

1. **Multiple Timer Support**: Solves the main user complaint about only showing one timer
2. **Improved UX**: Better visual hierarchy and information density
3. **Modern Design**: Innovative tile-based layout matching user's "Kachel uhren" request
4. **Performance**: Optimized rendering with RepaintBoundary and efficient animations
5. **Accessibility**: Better semantic structure and user feedback
