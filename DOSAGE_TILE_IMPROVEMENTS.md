# Dosage Tile Height and Visual Improvements

## Summary of Changes

The dosage tiles (Dosiskacheln) in the dose manager have been optimized for better height proportions and visual harmony. The tiles were previously too stretched in height and needed refinement.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Height and Aspect Ratio Adjustments

**Before:**
- DosageCard aspect ratio: 1.2 (too tall and stretched)
- Enhanced substance cards: 280-320px height
- SubstanceCard: 220-320px height
- Grid spacing: 16px

**After:**
- DosageCard aspect ratio: 0.95 (more compact and harmonious)
- Enhanced substance cards: 240-280px height (reduced by 40px)
- SubstanceCard: 200-260px height (reduced by 60px)
- Grid spacing: 12px (tighter, more polished layout)

### 2. Visual Styling Improvements

**Padding and Spacing:**
- Reduced main card padding from 16px to 14px
- Reduced icon container padding from 8px to 7px
- Reduced grid spacing from 16px to 12px for tighter layout
- Optimized spacing between elements for better proportions

**Typography:**
- Reduced title font size from 16px to 15px
- Reduced dose text from 24px to 22px
- Reduced duration text from 14px to 13px
- Reduced administration route badge text from 12px to 11px

**Border Radius:**
- Improved consistency: reduced main border radius from 24px to 18px
- Reduced icon container radius from 12px to 10px
- Reduced administration badge radius from 8px to 7px

### 3. Layout Optimizations

**Grid Layout:**
- Improved childAspectRatio to 0.85 for optimal proportions
- Reduced margins between cards from 8px to 6px
- Reduced overall container height from 650px to 580px

**Content Organization:**
- More compact recommended dose section (70-90px → 60-75px)
- Optimized icon sizes (24px → 22px for substance icons, 20px → 18px for card icons)
- Better vertical spacing distribution

## Files Modified

1. **`lib/widgets/dosage_card.dart`**
   - Adjusted aspect ratio from 1.2 to 0.95
   - Reduced padding and spacing throughout
   - Improved border radius consistency

2. **`lib/screens/dosage_calculator/dosage_calculator_screen.dart`**
   - Updated enhanced substance card dimensions
   - Improved grid layout with 0.85 aspect ratio
   - Reduced container heights and spacing

3. **`lib/widgets/dosage_calculator/substance_card.dart`**
   - Reduced height constraints for more compact appearance
   - Optimized padding calculations

4. **`lib/screens/dosage_card_example_screen.dart`**
   - Applied consistent spacing improvements
   - Updated grid configuration for harmony

## Visual Impact

These changes result in:
- **More compact tiles** that don't look stretched
- **Better visual harmony** with consistent proportions
- **Improved information density** without clutter
- **More polished appearance** with refined spacing
- **Better grid layout** that feels more balanced

The dose manager now presents a more professional and visually appealing interface where users can quickly scan dosage information without the tiles feeling too tall or visually overwhelming.
