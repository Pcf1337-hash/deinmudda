# Timer Layout Optimization for Substance Name Visibility

## Problem Statement (German)
"bitte behalte das design bei das sie nebneinander bleiben und nicht untereinander dieses würde bei mehreren timern einfach scheisse aussehen"

**Translation**: "please keep the design so they stay next to each other and not underneath each other, this would look shit with multiple timers"

## Analysis
The user wanted to maintain the horizontal (side-by-side) layout for multiple timers while improving the visibility of substance names that were being truncated. The horizontal layout was already working correctly, but the internal spacing and text layout within each timer tile needed optimization.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Optimized Tile Width for Better Text Visibility
- **Before**: `(constraints.maxWidth * 0.3).clamp(110.0, 150.0)` 
- **After**: `(constraints.maxWidth * 0.32).clamp(115.0, 160.0)`

### 2. Size Comparison by Screen Size

| Screen Width | Old Size | New Size | Improvement |
|-------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| 320px       | 110px    | 115px    | +4.5%       |
| 400px       | 120px    | 128px    | +6.7%       |
| 600px       | 150px    | 160px    | +6.7%       |

### 3. Internal Layout Optimizations
- **Reduced padding**: From `tileHeight * 0.1` to `tileHeight * 0.08` for more text space
- **Smaller icons**: From `tileHeight * 0.15` to `tileHeight * 0.12` with reduced padding
- **Compact progress indicators**: Smaller size and thinner stroke for more text area
- **Increased text flex**: From `flex: 2` to `flex: 3` for substance names
- **Optimized font sizes**: Better balance between readability and space efficiency
- **Tighter line height**: `height: 1.1` for better text fitting

### 4. Files Updated
1. **lib/widgets/multi_timer_display.dart**: Updated tile width and internal layout optimization
2. **test/widgets/multi_timer_display_test.dart**: Updated tests to reflect new calculations
3. **TIMER_TILE_WIDTH_REDUCTION_SUMMARY.md**: Updated documentation

## Benefits
- ✅ **Maintained side-by-side layout**: Horizontal scrolling preserved as requested
- ✅ **Better substance name visibility**: 4.5-6.7% more width plus optimized internal spacing
- ✅ **Reduced text truncation**: More space allocated to substance names with `flex: 3`
- ✅ **Optimized space utilization**: Compact icons and spacing for more text area
- ✅ **Preserved responsive behavior**: Still adapts to different screen sizes correctly
- ✅ **Maintained performance**: All existing optimizations preserved

## Technical Notes
The changes focus on the balance between compactness and text visibility:
- Slightly increased tile width while maintaining the horizontal layout
- Optimized internal spacing to give more room for substance names
- Reduced secondary UI elements (icons, progress indicators) to prioritize text
- Enhanced text layout with better flex allocation and tighter spacing

The horizontal layout is maintained exactly as the user requested, while substance names now have significantly more space to display without truncation.
